3d shooting survival game. We are planning to make an updated version of the game we designed last semester. The overall structure is similar. Players are put on a desert island, there are different monsters and terrains on the desert island, there will be a poisonous circle that gradually shrinks like PUBG, we need to find as many treasure as possible before we die or kill the target monster.
